# Considerate Communication

When engaging in discussions or making suggestions, it’s important to maintain a respectful and considerate tone. The open-source community thrives on collaboration and mutual respect. Disparaging comments or unconstructive criticism can hinder progress and negatively impact the community spirit. Remember, online or offline, kindness and respect go a long way.

# Informed Judgements

Before forming an opinion or making a judgement, ensure you have all the necessary information. If there’s something you’re unsure about, don’t hesitate to ask. Constructive dialogue can lead to better understanding and outcomes. It’s important to approach each situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn.

# Project Clarification

This project is not a closed-source initiative, a fork of Mozilla’s source code, or a modification of it. It provides optimized compiled binaries and should not be confused with custom forks like Mercury or Thorium. While forks can offer ‘security-hardened versions’ like Librewolf, they often lag behind in patches due to the nature of downstream source repositories. To ensure ease of compilation, timely patches, and a ‘pure’ build, this project will not fork the official source. For those interested in the source code, please refer to the official Python script provided for fetching the source. A mozconfig file is also available with all the flags necessary for compiling from the source.

Remember, the open-source community thrives on collaboration, respect, and understanding. Let’s maintain a positive and productive environment for everyone involved.
