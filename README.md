# HellFire

**HellFire** is a highly optimized Firefox build that prioritizes absolute performance. It is a 1:1 compile without any source, configuration or visual changes. Just pure Firefox compiled for maximum performance.

## Releases

Linux releases take at-least 1-2 days extra due to compilation drive restrictions. Windows builds are 5x times faster because of Dev Drive being used.

- Windows Releases

## Security

- As secure as original Firefox browser due to this being 1:1 identical build
- No security features are added or removed
- Patch state matches that of the latest Nightly branch

## Updates

- If you are not able to update directly from within Firefox UI, please check here for new releases.

## Support?

If you like the huge performance improvements this provides, please consider supporting me via UPI (India only) and do write a note for 'HellFire Support'. Thanks for using this build!
